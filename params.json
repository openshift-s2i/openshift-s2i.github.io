This provides a central repository for custom builder images, with the benefits of collaborative maintenance: for example, ensuring continuity of project maintenance in the event that you take a vacation or decide to stop working on the project.\r\n\r\nAlthough this project is not directly affiliated with or supported by with [Red Hat](https://redhat.com), many of the [OpenShift Origin](https://www.openshift.org) maintainers also contribute here, so your project benefits from expert review.\r\n\r\n# Guidelines\r\n\r\n* All contributions MUST be submitted under a suitable open-source license to ensure legal redistribution.  We suggest the Apache License version 2, in order to guarantee compatibility with the OpenShift Origin project itself\r\n* Copyrightable contributions SHOULD be accompanied with a statement stating compliance with the project license.  We suggest the built-in Git \"sign-off\" method using the Linux Foundation's [Developer Certificate of Origin](http://developercertificate.org/).
